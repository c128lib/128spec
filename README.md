# 128spec - 8502/Commodore128 Testing Framework for KickAssembler

## Installation

### Gradle way

Edit your <code>build.gradle</code> file and add a <code>libFromGitHub</code> to specify 128spec dependency.
Be sure to add also a <code>viceExecutable = 'x128.exe'</code> because retro-assembler plugin default emulator is c64.

```gradle
retroProject {
    viceExecutable = 'x128.exe'

    libFromGitHub "c128lib/128spec", "0.7.2"
}
```

### Other way

1. Create a dir for libraries that your KickAssembler projects use.
2. Get the current version of the 128spec.asm file and put it in this dir along with other libraries. 
3. Import it in your spec files as <code>#import "128spec.asm"</code>
4. Make sure to pass option <code>-libdir <path-to-your-libraries-dir></code> when compiling with KickAssembler.

### If you just want to try it out

1. Get the current version of the 128spec.asm file and put it in the same directory as your spec files.
2. Import it in your spec files as <code>#import "128spec.asm"</code>

## Quick Start

#### 1. Create file example_spec.asm

``` asm
#import "128spec.asm"

sfspec: init_spec()
  
  // TODO: Add assertions here

  finish_spec()
```

![Empty Spec](docs/qs01-empty.png?raw=true "Empty Spec")

#### 2. Add first failing assertion.

``` asm
#import "128spec.asm"

sfspec: init_spec()
  
  lda #0
  assert_a_equal #42

  finish_spec()
```

![Empty Spec](docs/qs02-fail.png?raw=true "Test failed")

#### 3. Make it pass

``` asm
#import "128spec.asm"

sfspec: init_spec()

  lda #42
  assert_a_equal #42
  
  finish_spec()
```

![Empty Spec](docs/qs03-pass.png?raw=true "Test passed")
